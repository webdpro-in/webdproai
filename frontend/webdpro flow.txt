Ecommerce SaaS | AWS-Only | India-Scale | Multi-Tenant | Zero-Gap

SYSTEM GOAL

Build WebdPro, a full-stack, multi-tenant, prompt-to-ecommerce SaaS platform, entirely on AWS managed services, private, scalable for India-scale traffic, with only two third-party integrations:

Razorpay – subscriptions, UPI, COD reconciliation, merchant payouts

Domain Registrar API (Hostinger) – domain search & purchase

The platform must generate, deploy, manage, and monetize sector-specific commerce websites in ≤ 10 minutes, with strict tenant isolation, role-based dashboards, and no manual DevOps.

CORE ROLES (STRICT)

Company Founder (Super Admin)

Business Owner (Merchant)

Delivery Agent

Customer

Each role has isolated UI, permissions, and data scope.

END-TO-END USER STORY (REFERENCE FLOW)

Raj logs in on mobile → OTP → dashboard → sees 3 live stores → clicks Generate New Store → enters prompt → edits → pays → site goes live → orders → delivery → payouts → admin monitoring.

This exact flow must be supported without gaps.
